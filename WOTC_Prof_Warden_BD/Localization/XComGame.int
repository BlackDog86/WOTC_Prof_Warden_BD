ClassSummary="Wardens represent a militarised wing of the Templars and excel in harnessing the ebb and flow of psionic energies on the battlefield. Wardens start each turn by alternating their stance which boosts capability with one of their weapons. Carrying out a turn-ending attack with the correct weapon & stance combination grants the warden a 'flow' action point which they can use to activate powerful abilities.
